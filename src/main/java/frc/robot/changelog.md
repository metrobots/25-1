Programmers! This is the format that your commit messages need to be in. Try to make many smaller commits instead of one large big commit. Make your messages detailed but somewhat short,
focusing on detail.

- File(s) Changed / Changes Made (Detailed) / Name of contributor (First & Last) / MM.DD.YY -

An example commit message would be:

- Vision.java / Added two methods for calculating position to Vision.java / Mateo Johnson / 01.01.01 -
